<img align="right" src="./assests/readmenbsb.png" width="400"/>
Tech enthusiast and problem-solver with a passion for learning. 
<br/>I'm a 34-year-old electronics repair technician at Worten Resolve, specializing in a wide range of devices from smartphones to home appliances.

My curiosity drives me to constantly explore new technologies and software. I enjoy hands-on work and am always eager to take on new challenges. Efficiency is important to me, and I've developed methods to manage time effectively.

While I thrive in the fast-paced world of technology, I also value tranquility and focus in my personal life. 
<br/>I'm currently expanding my skills through programming projects at **42 school**, aiming to combine my practical experience with new software development knowledge.

Always open to collaboration and excited to contribute to innovative projects!
